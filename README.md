Single page WordPress template for the "Interactive Multimedia" Master's Degree at Université Panthéon-Sorbonne, Paris, FR.

## General Information

Supervised by the Master's Degree Director, the website redesign was first carried out by the entire class ("Frutiger" 2021-2022) as design work : UX, UI, graphic-design, etc. Then it became an assignment for each student at the “Advanced Front-end development" course during the Master's Degree. I choose to code the "Portfolio" and the "Project" pages templates.

## Key Features

Mandatory for both the "Portfolio" and the "Project" page :
- coded as WordPress [“page.php”](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/#page-templates-within-the-template-hierarchy)
- must be responsive (desktop, tablet and mobile)
- must use CSS3 [Bulma framework](https://bulma.io/) 
- must use JavaScript [Gsap library](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- must have at least one animation per page
