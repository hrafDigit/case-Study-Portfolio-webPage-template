Single page WordPress template for the "*Interactive Multimedia*" Master's Degree at Université *Panthéon-Sorbonne*, Paris (France).

## General Information

Supervised by D. Bihanic — Associate Professor in charge of the Master's Degree — the website redesign was first carried out by the entire class ("Frutiger" 2021-2022) as design work: UX, UI, graphic-design, etc. 
Then it became an assignment for each student at the “Advanced Front-end development" course during the Master's Degree. I choose to code the "Portfolio" and the "Project" pages templates.

## Key Features

Mandatory for all pages including the "Portfolio" and the "Project" page :
- must be responsive (desktop, tablet and mobile)
- must use CSS3 [Bulma framework](https://bulma.io/) 
- must use JavaScript [Gsap library](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- must have at least one animation per page
