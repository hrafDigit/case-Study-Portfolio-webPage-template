Single page WordPress template for the "Interactive Multimedia" Master's Degree at Université Panthéon-Sorbonne, Paris, FR.

## General Information

Under Master's Degree Director supervision, the website redesign was first carried out by the entire class ("Frutiger" 2021-2022) as design work : UX, UI, graphic-design, etc. Then it became an assignment for each student at the “Advanced Front-end development" course during the Master's Degree. I choose to code the "Portfolio" and the "Project" pages template.

## Other CodeSandbox repositories

Mandatory for both the "Portfolio" and the "Project" page :
- coded as WordPress [“page.php”](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/#page-templates-within-the-template-hierarchy)
- responsive (desktop, tablet and mobile)
- using [Bulma framework](https://bulma.io/)
- using [Gsap library](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- at least one animation per page

## Other CodeSandbox repositories

CodeSandbox consists of several separate servers, some of which are open
sourced.

- Client: the web application
- Server: the [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) API server
- Nginx: Nginx config files
- [Git Extractor](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-importers):
  responsible for extracting the source from a GitHub repository
- [CLI](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-importers/tree/master/packages/cli):
  the CLI to upload a CodeSandbox project from your command line
